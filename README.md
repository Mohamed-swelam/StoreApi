### ðŸŽ¯ Architecture Highlights:

-Repository Pattern: Repositories are used to manage data access logic, making database operations for products, categories, and orders modular and reusable.

-Unit of Work: By implementing the Unit of Work pattern, I ensure that all database transactions are handled as a single atomic operation, promoting consistency and reducing potential issues with multiple changes.

-Service Layer: The business logic is abstracted into a dedicated service layer, keeping controllers lightweight and focused on HTTP requests.

-DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): To ensure secure and efficient data exchange between the API and the client, DTOs are used for handling requests and responses.
